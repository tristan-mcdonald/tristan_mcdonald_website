Hi, I'm Tristan McDonald.

I design to answer the question, "what does this need to do, and how best can it do that?"

I write code to answer the question, "what will I be glad of when I come back to this codebase in five years time?"

My main contribution to open-source is my CSS framework for designing and building maintainable frontends, Tenet >

I've been busy in my role as Principal of Frontend and Design at Omni Digital, but I do my best to keep producing articles >

Say hi >
