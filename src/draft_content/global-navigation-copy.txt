Having read this far, you may be interested in who I am as a person.

    I have a patient, respectful and collaborative approach to leadership. I count many of the people I have lead as my most valued friends.
    I value work which creates a value greater than capital.
    I have worked in the industry long enough to value pragmatic and robust solutions to problems over exciting tech, and I have waded through enough legacy codebases to warmly favour defensive, risk-averse code.
