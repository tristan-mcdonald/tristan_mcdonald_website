        <p>I design to answer the question, "what does this need to do, and how best can it do that?"</p>
        <p>I write software to answer the question, "what will I be glad of when I come back to this codebase in five years' time?"</p>
        <p>I come from a family of communication designers, and I've been building for the web since the 1990s. I have project management experience, and I've led engineering teams through many technical challenges.</p>
        <p>My main contribution to open-source is my CSS framework for designing and building maintainable frontends, <a href="https://github.com/trubblebruin/tenet">Tenet CSS</a>.</p>
        <p>For the past few years I worked as <em>Principal of Frontend Engineering & Design</em> at a software house in Bristol, and now I'm contracting.</p>
