                <p>Hi, I'm Tristan McDonald 🌞</p>
                <p>I design user interfaces to help people understand the services they rely on, and I write codebases that I'll be glad to revisit in a decade.</p>
                <p>I'm a

                    </script> years of experience working in software, and more in design, logistics, and management.</p>
                <p>In teams I communicate clearly and work respectfully. I design thoughtful &amp; appropriate user interfaces, I write readable &amp; robust code, and I enjoy finding flexible solutions to systems architecture problems.</p>
                <p>I have worked extensively with Django and custom Python applications. My expertise is in advanced CSS, design-in-code, data modelling & templating for applications, and writing dependable behavioural JS.</p>
                <p>My clients include the United Nations, Oxford University, and various NHS trusts, as well as many other healthcare, government, NGO, FinTech, and private organisations.</p>
                <p>My main contribution to open-source is my framework for designing and building maintainable frontends, <a href="https://github.com/tristan-mcdonald/tenet">Tenet CSS</a>.</p>
                <p>I've lead design workshops at Oxford University, and I designed the beta version of the NHS style guide. I come from a family of communication designers, have worked freelance as a designer in parallel to my other career roles.</p>
                <p>I founded and ran a small software agency for five years, I worked as <em>Principal of Frontend Engineering & Design</em> at a software company in Bristol, and I currently work for a Web3-based FinTech organisation.</p>
